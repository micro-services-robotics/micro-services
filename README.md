# Introduction to MSR
We started designing MSR as part of a graduation project. We firmly believe that electronics and robotics in a larger framework must be as accessible as possible. Today the design of electronic devices is long and complex, beyond the reach of non-expert. This is a shame, because many innovative ideas come from people who are not experts. That's why we looked into the question and we provide an answer with MSR. MSR allows all electronics and code to be encapsulated in one module. Each module is a node of the network. If you want to add a new features you just need to connect the nodes in the network and update the network to recognize them.
